# MLAgents-NUITRACK-REALSENSE
## Intro
ML-Agents and NUITRACK detect target's emotion. And reaction to target.

Some sick people want shared there's feeling with anythings. Sometimes. But it's not easy. So I want they are sharing feels with A.I.

This project is first step my hope.

## Using
NUITRACK SDK(Face-track).

INTEL REALSENS(d435i).

ML-Agents(Unity3D).

## Progress
Success Connecting RealSense with Unity3D.

Success detecting target's emotions with applying NuitrackSDK.

Success Connecting NuitrackSDK with ML-Agents. (Inheriting Agent Class in FaceManager class in NuitrackSDK).

Currently, training AI(Using Imitation Learning), and I plan to connect Unity-chan, a 3d model.

## Scene Location
Assets\FaceTracker\FinalAssets\FaceTracking.unity

## Description
This project have a 2 brain. One is Player brain in Unity's ML-Agents. Another is Learning brain

This brain waiting at inputting 2 observing values. (one is emotion. Another is my intentions(It's just sending with key code)) free Nuitrack has a limit 3 minutes. So I can't progress Learning with NuitrackSDK.

Anyway new brain(Learning Brain) imitate player brain's decision with imitation Learning.

In this case, Imitation Learning, player brain is teacher brain and the new brain, Learning brain(In Unity's ML-Agents brain), be student brain. So student brain decide following teacher brain decision.
